    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook we'll be going through an end-to-end project to load in long form transactional type data, prepare the data into a wide format, build some machine learning models, and then deploy those built models. Our long form data contains a feature named `EVENT_TYPE_ID` which contains events that the customer has experienced. In this project we're specifically looking for the events with the prefix `LFE_`. These events are significant <b>Life Events</b> that have been experienced by the client and we're going to be specifically targeting two life events for this project: `LFE_RELOCATION` and `LFE_HOME_PURHCASE`. Therefore, we are going to build some machine learning models to help predict the likelihood of these two events occurring for our clients.\n",

    "The easiest way to load in data is to use the `Find and Add Data` icon in the upper right hand corner. Once selected you will see a sidebar come out with options to load from either local, remote, or other.\n",

    "If you loaded your dataset into an Analytics Project, like a CSV file, then select Local and you should be able to find your dataset name. From there you can click the `Insert to code` and select to either insert a pandas dataframe or a spark dataframe. Once you make the selection you'll see python code inserted into the notebook cell with either Pandas or PySpark code for reading in your data. Now you're ready to explore and manipulate your dataset.\n",
